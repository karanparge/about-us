                Maharashtra's flora is highly diverse, reflecting the state's varied topography and climate. The Western Ghats, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is a biodiversity hotspot with tropical evergreen forests rich in endemic species like teak, bamboo, and medicinal plants. The Deccan Plateau features dry deciduous forests, where teak, neem, and banyan trees are common, along with scrub forests and grasslands. Along the Konkan coast, mangrove ecosystems thrive, supporting a unique range of plant and animal life. This diverse flora is vital for maintaining ecological balance, supporting wildlife, and contributing to agriculture and medicinal practices.

                    <b>Description: </b>Shrub or tree with multiple branches, grows 3 to 14 m tall. Smooth light grey bark has thin, stiff, brittle flakes, and this gives it the common name. Bright, glossy, green leaves are thick and 5-8 cm long. On the underside, the leaves are silvery white or grey, with very small matted hairs. Flowers white or golden yellow, in clusters of 3-5, small, almost 1 cm across. Fruit contains a large fleshy seed, often germinating on the tree and falling as a seedling.

                    <b>Habits & Habitat: </b>A gregarious species seen in large stretches along the estuarine region and creeks. This is the first among mangrove species to establish itself in new habitats.

                <p style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
                    <b>Description: </b>Evergreen tree, much taller than Grey Mangrove, grows up to 25 m in height with a 1 m wide trunk. Bark brownish grey, becomes rough and blackish as the tree matures. Leaves 4-12 cm long, rounded at tip, acute or rounded at base, thick, leathery, with edges slightly rolled under. Upper leaf surface shiny green and hairless, underside with fine grey-green hairs and resin dots. Flowers stalkless, yellow or yellow-brown, in clusters of 2-12. Fruits broad with a short beak, covered with short yellowish brown hairs. Seed large, flattened, without seed coat, germinates in water. Numerous upright air-filled roots rise above soil from long shallow, horizontal roots. Like other Avicennia species, it has pencil-like pneumatophores.

                    <b>Description: </b>Small to medium-sized evergreen tree, its many spreading branches have brown to greyish black bark. Leaves simple, obovate, margin slightly notched, and arranged in spirals confined towards the ends of twigs. Small white flowers seen on terminal spikes in the axils (the upper angle between the leaf and the stem). Flowers fragrant. Woody, vase-shaped, compressed fruits are glossy yellowish green, with one seed. Lacks buttresses, but has breathing roots (pneumatophores), and sometimes stilt roots.

                    <b>Habits & Habitat: </b>Common and fairly widespread, it normally has a rounded, low crown, with branches that root into the mud below. But in overcrowded areas, it may adopt a narrower form, with a more conical crown and a single trunk, and can grow up to 18 m tall.
