                    The Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board (MSBB) is an autonomous body under the Government of Maharashtra's Department of Environment and Climate Change. It is situated in the premises of the Maharashtra State Forest Department. As per the provision made in Section 22 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, the State Government of Maharashtra constituted the Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board in the year 2008 vide Notification No. WLP/1008/CR/147/F-1, dated: 02/01/2008.

                <h1>REGIONAL SEGMENTATION</h1>
                <hr>
                <p style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
                    Maharashtra is regionally segregated into Eastern and Western parts. This segregation includes Eastern Maharashtra, comprising Vidarbha and Marathwada, and Western Maharashtra, which includes Desh, Khandesh, and Konkan.

                <h3>Eastern Maharashtra: Vidarbha and Marathwada</h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
                    Vidarbha, located in the easternmost part of Maharashtra, is characterized by its rich and diverse forest ecosystems. This region is home to several protected areas and wildlife sanctuaries, including the famous Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve, Pench National Park, and Melghat Tiger Reserve. These forests are part of the larger Central Indian forest belt, which is a critical tiger habitat. The biodiversity in Vidarbha includes a variety of flora, such as teak, bamboo, and mixed deciduous forests, and fauna, including tigers, leopards, sloth bears, and numerous bird species. Vidarbha's biodiversity is threatened by factors like deforestation, mining, and human-wildlife conflict, particularly in the more rural and forested areas.

                    <br>
                    Marathwada, situated to the southwest of Vidarbha, is less forested and more arid, with a semi-arid climate that supports a different type of biodiversity. The region's biodiversity is more agricultural and dryland-focused, with scrub forests, grasslands, and drought-resistant species of plants. The Jayakwadi Bird Sanctuary, located near the Nathsagar reservoir in Aurangabad, is a significant wetland habitat that attracts a variety of migratory and resident bird species, including flamingos, cranes, and storks. Marathwada faces challenges such as water scarcity, over-exploitation of groundwater, and habitat fragmentation, which have a negative impact on its biodiversity.

                <h3>Western Maharashtra: Desh, Khandesh, and Konkan</h3>
                <p style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
                    Desh, the central and western part of Maharashtra, is a region with a diverse landscape that includes river valleys, plateaus, and hills. The Western Ghats, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the world's eight "hottest hotspots" of biological diversity, extends into this region, especially around Pune and Satara. The Western Ghats are known for their exceptional biodiversity, hosting a wide range of endemic species of plants, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The region's biodiversity includes evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, grasslands, and a variety of endemic species. However, this biodiversity is under pressure from urbanization, agriculture, and climate change, which threaten the unique ecosystems in the area

                    <br>
                    Khandesh, located in the northwestern part of Maharashtra, features a mix of semi-arid landscapes, agricultural lands, and riverine ecosystems along the Tapi River. The biodiversity in Khandesh includes dry deciduous forests, grasslands, and riverine habitats that support species adapted to these environments. The region is known for its avian diversity, with species like the Indian grey hornbill, peafowl, and various raptors being commonly observed. Khandesh's biodiversity is vulnerable to changes in land use, overgrazing, and water management issues, which can lead to habitat degradation.

                    Konkan, the coastal region of Maharashtra, is arguably the most biodiverse area in the state, thanks to its location along the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea. The Konkan region includes lush tropical forests, mangroves, estuaries, and rich marine ecosystems. The Western Ghats in Konkan are home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, including many endemic species of plants, amphibians, and reptiles. The coastal and marine biodiversity includes mangrove forests, coral reefs, and a variety of marine life, including fish, crustaceans, and marine mammals like dolphins. The mangroves of Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg are particularly important for maintaining coastal biodiversity and protecting against erosion. However, the region faces significant threats from coastal development, pollution, deforestation, and climate change, which endanger its rich biodiversity

                    <h1> GEOGRAPHICAL SEGMENTATION</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
                        Maharashtra, one of India's most populous states, has a population of approximately 123 million people, according to estimates from 2021. This makes it the second-most populous state in India, after Uttar Pradesh. The state has a population density of about 365 people per square kilometer, indicating a relatively high concentration of people in certain areas, particularly in urban centers. Maharashtra's population is highly diverse, with a mix of communities, languages, and cultures contributing to its rich social fabric.                         
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Urbanization in Maharashtra is significant, with nearly 45% of the population residing in urban areas. This urban population is concentrated in major cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, and Nashik. Mumbai, the state capital and financial hub of India, is the largest city in Maharashtra, with a population exceeding 20 million people in its metropolitan area. Pune, known for its educational institutions and IT industry, is another major urban center with a rapidly growing population. Nagpur, in the Vidarbha region, serves as an important commercial and political center, while Nashik, located in the northern part of the state, is known for its religious significance and wine production.

                        <br>
                        The rural population of Maharashtra, making up about 55% of the total, is spread across various regions, including the fertile plains of Western Maharashtra, the dry lands of Marathwada, and the forested areas of Vidarbha. Agriculture is the primary occupation in these rural areas, with crops like sugarcane, cotton, and rice being widely cultivated. Despite the state's overall economic development, there are disparities in income and access to services between urban and rural areas, leading to ongoing challenges in rural development and poverty alleviation.

                        Maharashtra's demographic profile also reflects a diverse linguistic and cultural landscape. Marathi is the official language and is widely spoken across the state, but other languages like Hindi, Gujarati, Urdu, and English are also commonly used, particularly in urban areas. The state is home to various communities, including Marathas, Brahmins, Dalits, and Adivasis (tribal groups), each contributing to the cultural richness of the region. The religious composition of Maharashtra is predominantly Hindu, followed by significant Muslim, Buddhist, Christian, and Jain populations.
